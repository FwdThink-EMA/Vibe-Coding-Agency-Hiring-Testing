# Application Test – Code Review and Deployment Pipeline Orchestration

This test evaluates your ability to break down complex engineering workflows, structure AI-assisted review processes, and design deployment pipeline strategies.

You will complete your work **directly inside the provided notebook**:

`Candidate Version Technical Challenge - Code Review and Deployment Pipeline Orchestration.ipynb`

When finished, you will **export the notebook to PDF** and submit it.

---

## Deliverable Format

Submit a **single PDF** created from the completed notebook.

```
submission/application-test.pdf
```

No additional files, folders, screenshots, or external links are required.

All responses must be written **in the provided response cells** in the notebook.

## Scenario

A mid-size engineering organization needs to improve the speed, quality, and consistency of code reviews and deployments across 50+ microservices.

Current challenges:
- Code reviews take 2–3 days
- Review quality varies across teams
- Deployment failures occur due to missed issues
- Rollbacks are manual and slow
- Deployment pipelines differ across teams/environments

### Business Goals
- Reduce review turnaround to **< 4 hours**
- Detect **90%+** security issues pre-deployment
- Standardize deployment workflows
- Automate rollback decision-making
- Support new features and hotfix releases

## Instructions

### 1. Open the Notebook
Open the notebook in VS Code, Jupyter, or your environment of choice.

### 2. Fill in Each Response Section
The notebook is divided into **four parts**, each with clearly labeled response cells.

You must answer:

- **Part A:** Problem Decomposition  
- **Part B:** AI Prompting Strategy  
- **Part C:** System Architecture & Reusability  
- **Part D:** Implementation Roadmap & Risk Management

Use bullet points, tables, or short diagrams where helpful.

### 3. Export to PDF

### 4. Submit Your PDF
Place your final exported file into:

```
submission/application-test.pdf
```
