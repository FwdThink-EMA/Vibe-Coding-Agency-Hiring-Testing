# Candidate Technical Evaluation

Thank you for your interest in joining our team. This repository contains a three‑part take‑home assessment. Your work will demonstrate solution design, security thinking, and practical review/deployment skills.

---

## Tests Included

1. **Cloud Test** – Cloud architecture and system design.
2. **Security Test** – Identification and remediation of security vulnerabilities.
3. **Application Test** – Code review and CI/CD pipeline planning.

Each test has its own folder with detailed instructions. Read those before you begin.

---

## How to Complete the Assessment

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Complete each test by following the instructions provided in its folder.
4. Place your final deliverables in the pre‑created `submission/` folder at the root of **your fork**.
5. **Do not** modify files outside of `submission/`.

When finished, push your changes to your fork and send us the **link to your forked repository**.

## Submission Structure (Single‑file per test)

All explanations, diagrams, and screenshots **must be embedded in a single PDF per test**. We ask for PDFs so that visuals are preserved in one file and grading stays consistent.

```
submission/
  cloud-test.pdf
  security-test.pdf
  application-test.pdf
```
---

## Formatting Requirements (applies to each PDF)

- Use clear section headings that match the per‑test README.  
- Embed diagrams/screenshots directly in the PDF (no separate image files).  
- Use monospace code blocks for commands or snippets.  
- Prefer concise, evidence‑based reasoning over lengthy prose.

---

## Evaluation Criteria (high level)

- **Clarity & Structure** – Is your thinking easy to follow?  
- **Technical Depth** – Are trade‑offs, constraints, and risks addressed?  
- **Security Mindset** – For the Security Test, are findings accurate and fixes correct?  
- **Operational Practicality** – For the Application Test, is the CI/CD plan realistic and safe?  
- **Completeness** – Did you follow instructions and provide all deliverables?

---

## Environment & Tools

- You may use any diagramming tool and export to PDF.  
- Code examples are welcome inside the PDFs as snippets.
