# Security Test

This test evaluates your ability to identify, explain, and remediate security vulnerabilities in Python application code. The codebase provided contains multiple issues related to secrets handling, database access, network requests, cloud integration, and input validation.

---

## Objective

Review the provided Python code and produce a clear, structured security report that:

1. Identifies each vulnerability.
2. Explains the risk and potential impact.
3. Maps each vulnerability to an appropriate CWE/OWASP category.
4. Provides corrected and secure code.
5. Demonstrates how to verify the fix.

---

## What to Submit

Submit the following in **a single PDF** named:

```
submission/security-test.pdf
```

Additionally, submit your corrected Python source code in:

```
submission/security-fixed-code.zip
```

Your PDF must include:

### 1. Vulnerability Table

| ID | Issue | Severity | Root Cause | CWE/OWASP Reference | Location |
|----|--------|----------|------------|---------------------|----------|

List each issue as one row, then expand in detail below.

### 2. Detailed Explanations 

For each vulnerability, include:

- **Description** — what the issue is
- **Impact** — what could happen if exploited
- **Evidence** — reference the line(s) of code
- **Fix** — describe how you remediated the issue
- **Verification** — describe how to confirm the fix works
